Great question! Let me help you understand the secure path and what you've been using.

## ÔøΩÔøΩ **What You've Been Using**

When you run `sudo systemctl start urvote`, it's using the **default service file** (`urvote.service`), which runs as:
- **User**: `adminrocks` (your admin account)
- **Security Level**: ‚ùå Less secure

## ÔøΩÔøΩÔ∏è **The More Secure Path**

To use the secure service, you need to:

### **1. Create the Dedicated Service User**
```bash
# Create urvote user and group
sudo useradd -r -s /bin/false -d /opt/urvote urvote
sudo usermod -aG adminrocks urvote
```

### **2. Set Proper Permissions**
```bash
# Give urvote user access to the app directory
sudo chown -R urvote:urvote /opt/urvote
sudo chmod -R 755 /opt/urvote
```

### **3. Switch to the Secure Service**
```bash
# Stop the current service
sudo systemctl stop urvote

# Copy the secure service file
sudo cp urvote-secure.service /etc/systemd/system/urvote.service

# Reload systemd and start the secure service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl start urvote
```

## ÔøΩÔøΩ **Why This is More Secure**

### **Current (Less Secure):**
- Runs as `adminrocks` (your admin account)
- If compromised, attacker has admin access
- Can modify system files, access other users' data

### **Secure Version:**
- Runs as `urvote` (dedicated service user)
- If compromised, limited access
- Can only access app files, not system files

## üöÄ **Quick Migration**

Want me to help you switch to the secure version? It's a simple process that will make your app much more secure for production use.


Let me check what the `install-systemd.sh` script does:

## **What `install-systemd.sh` Does**

This is an **automated installation script** for setting up your UrVote service! üöÄ

### **üîß What It Does Step-by-Step:**

1. **Creates Secure User** - Sets up `urvote` user for security
2. **Sets Permissions** - Proper file ownership and permissions
3. **Installs Service** - Copies `urvote-secure.service` to systemd
4. **Enables Service** - Makes it start automatically on boot
5. **Starts Service** - Launches UrVote immediately
6. **Shows Status** - Displays if it's running properly

### **ÔøΩÔøΩ Key Features:**

- **Security-First** - Uses dedicated `urvote` user (not admin)
- **Automated Setup** - One command does everything
- **Error Handling** - Stops if something goes wrong
- **Status Check** - Shows you if it worked
- **Helpful Commands** - Gives you useful commands to manage it

### **ÔøΩÔøΩ How to Use It:**

```bash
# Run the installation script
sudo ./install-systemd.sh
```

### **‚úÖ What You Get After Running:**

- **Secure service** running as `urvote` user
- **Auto-start** on server reboot
- **Easy management** with systemctl commands
- **Proper logging** via journalctl

### ** Perfect for Production!**

This script automates the secure setup we discussed earlier. Instead of manually:
- Creating the user
- Setting permissions  
- Copying service files
- Enabling/starting

**This script does it all in one go!** ÔøΩÔøΩ
